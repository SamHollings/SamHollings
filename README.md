# Sam Hollings Github
## Data Scientist
I'm mostly concerned with developing data science tools to be used with health data. 

The tools I'm most interested in developing for:
- python
  - pyspark
  - pandas
  - sklearn
  - statsmodels
  - Tensorflow / Keras
  - Pytorch
- ANSI-SQL (specifically associated with spark)

The repositories I'm making split into a few categories:
- making data easier to use and access
- data science code (such as starter code, or explorations of techniques)
- documentation of existing health data
